The introductory repository, just fooling about.

The ServiceNet Applied Research division has been using a single desktop with STATA files to perform statistical analysis and some database work. This no longer suits our needs, so we are moving to a distributed GitHub page and a shared database setup.

Part of this is thanks to James Olchowski joining the team. He's able to work on these longer-term projects while Jennifer Geertsma focuses on providing the reporting and guidance that is required to keep ServiceNet up to date day-to-day.
